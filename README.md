# Real time Gender,age,object and facial emotion detector (All in one)

There are total 4 model used to build this


1 - Age model you will find inside the age_gender folder

2 - Gender model you will find it inside hte ade_gender folder.

3 - Facial emotion that you will find inside facial_emotion folder 

4 - object detection which is pre trained and the weights and the structure for that model are in object_detection folder


All the trained model are in their respective folder with the .h5 extension and the ipynb files are for can be used to understand how the model was trained.
Both of Age and gender models are trained with same dataset that was utkFaces you can find the dataset over here - https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/ and the
facial emotion model was trained with dataset which can be found here - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uldisvalainis/fergit.
Age_gender_facialEmotion_and _object_detector this file is where I bring all the models together and use it in realtime with the help of cv2.


Today, Gender,age,object and facial emotion recognition is the core of most vision-based AI software and programs. This detections plays an important role in scene understanding, which is popular in security, transportation, medical, and military use cases.
